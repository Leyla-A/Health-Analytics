## Health Analytics: Logistic Regression to Guide Treatment for Diabetes Patients

**Abstract** - Diabetes, which affects millions of lives worldwide, is
a chronic disease that requires constant monitoring and clinical
supervision to ensure life satisfaction of affected patients. Multitude of
tests must be carried out to effectively oversee the condition, different
medications may be prescribed at various stages and when outpatient
care is insufficient patients must be hospitalized promptly. In this work
we develop logistic regression models to predict medication change
and readmission into inpatient care from demographic and clinical visit
data and medical test results. We report that the logistic regression
model can successfully identify true positives of the test data with 77%
accuracy and the model has highest sensitivity to the results of select
medical tests. The results of this model can be used by clinicians to
decide whether certain tests should be recommended to guide the
diagnoses and medication prescriptions.
